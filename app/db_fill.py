* The biggest advantage of this book is to describe the implementation details of the computer system for programmers, to help them construct a hierarchical computer system in the brain, from the representation of the lowest data in memory to the composition of pipeline instructions, to virtual memory, To the compilation system, to the dynamic loading library, to the final user mode application. By mastering how the program is mapped to the system and how the program is executed, readers can better understand why the program behaves like this and how inefficiency is caused.
